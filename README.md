## Hello! 
### These are my notes during learning Python.

To be honest, I am a writer learner (dominant).
So, i take some notes and paraphrase what my lecturer said during class (#comment on .py).

Aside from taking notes during class, i rewrite it in a more structured way by handwriting on my textbook.
I also read some e-book to finding supplementary information on what i am learning about.


Wish me luck, it will be long journey.
Hwaiting!
